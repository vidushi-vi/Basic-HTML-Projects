    <h1>A Minimlaist Study Of Change</h1>
    <h3>February 18th 2004</h3>
    <p> Michael Gordon, a founder of Bang on a Can, is an eclectic composer whose music draws its energy from rock, Baroque concertos and Minimalism. Although he has said that Romantic symphony music doesn't interest him, there are moments in his works when a listener might have trouble believing that.

        One that has traveled particularly well is "Weather," a 70-minute work for chamber orchestra that Mr. Gordon composed for Ensemble Resonanz, a German group that recorded the piece soon after it gave the premiere in 1997. In its original version, the orchestra was seated on a series of risers that created a vertical effect, and there was a video component, by Elliot Caplan. But when the Ensemble Resonanz played the score at Miller Theater on Feb. 12, it played it straight up, with conventional seating and without its video adornments.
        
        Perhaps these embellishments were unnecessary: this is a work that pulls a listener in on its own. Its four movements are built largely on repeating figures that change gradually in the Minimalist fashion. But if repetition was a principal propulsion system, the riffs and textures of each movement evolved fairly rapidly. If there was anything in this music to reflect the work's title, in fact, it was change, sometimes gradual, sometimes suddenly.

    <p>But other things were also at work. In the opening movement, a slow layering creates a form of rhythmic counterpoint that becomes intricate, mechanistic and almost balletic before morphing into Vivaldi-like concerto figuration. Vivaldi flits by quickly, though; Mr. Gordon deconstructs this quasi-Baroque figuration and puts it under a Minimalist lens.The second movement was essentially an Adagio with a darker, more ominous hue. Here the element Mr. Gordon toyed with most was timbre, changing the string sound from deep and rounded to metallic and slightly harsh. The third movement begins with a series of recorded sirens, which the ensemble eventually joins, first extending the sirens' piercing timbre, but soon cloaking it in a lush, sustained chord that, if this were Haydn, might signify a sunrise or a parting of clouds.

        In the finale, the Baroque figuration returns, this time with the ensemble split into groups that play the same music displaced by a fraction of a beat, to create a slight echo effect. Here the string sound was wiry and harsh, but those seemed to be qualities that Mr. Gordon was aiming for.
        
        More of Mr. Gordon's music will be heard on Feb. 27, when his "Gotham" is given its world premiere by the American Composers Orchestra at Zankel Hall.
